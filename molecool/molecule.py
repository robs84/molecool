    '''Calculate bonds in a molecule based on a distance criteria

    The pairwise distance between atoms is computed.  If it is in the range
    'min_bond to 'max_bond, the atoms are counted as bonded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : np.ndarray
        The coordinates of the atoms.
    max_bond : floate (optional)
        The maximum distance for two atom to be considered bonded.  The default is 1.5
    min_bond: float (optional)
        The minimum distance for two points to be considered bonded.  The default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    bonds : dict
        A dictionary where the keys are tuples of the bonded atom indices, and the associated
        values are the bond lengths.
